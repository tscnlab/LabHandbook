## Day before measurement

#### Checklist: Make sure the following devices are fully charged. Do not let the devices charge throughout the entire night!
   1. Laptop
   2. Tablet
   3. Four external Makita batteries
   4. GoPro Hero 10 (white batteries)
 
    
#### Checklist: Make sure the following devices, cables and materials are in the shell-backpack
   1. Intel RealSenseD455 depth camera + brass screw
   2. GoPro Hero 10 + battery + 512 Gb microSD-card + long black screw
   3. Hard-Drive + USB 3.0 cable
   4. mini-USB cable (for Testo 175 H1)
   5. Laptop charger
   6. WP690 power cable
   7. Jeti lense
   8. micro-USB-cable


#### Checklist: Make sure the following devices and cables and materials are in/on the black box
   1. Circadiometer WP690 with attached lense cover
   2. Spectoradiometer Jeti 1511 with attached lense cover (orientated in the correct direction. Orientation of the mounting can be changed by loosening the large brass screw on the device
   3. Colorimeter Klein
   4. Therometer/Humidity Testo 175 H1 (mounting on the back of the box)
   5. USB-c-cable (for Depth camera)
   6.   

#### Checklist: Make sure the following procedures are completed 
   1. Devices on the black-box-rail are put in the back-position (so closing of the front lid does not cause damage on the devices)
   2. The white lid for the front opening of the black box is attached with all for hinges
   3. The two Actigraphs, their two data-transfer-casings, their two measurement-casings and a thin screw driver are put on the table next to the (charged) laptop
   4. Put the charged Makita batteries in the battery-backpack
   5. Check that the Testo display says "REC" for recording
   6. Optional: If you plan to do measurements where power is available, perpare a sufficient extension cable and a multiple power socket
   &rarr Additional device-specific procedures are included in the device SOPs (Templates/documentation/src/sops/light_measurement_devices)


## Day of measurement
_Come in the office at 30-45 minutes before the planned first measurement_

### Pre-measurement procedure
#### Actigraph preparation
   1. Use the screwdriver to put the two Actigraphs in the data-transfer-casings (old/white & new/white)
   2. Turn on the laptop (while it´s attached to the charger) and start the Acttrust software
   3. Attach the first data-transfer-casings to the laptop using the micro-USB cable. 
   4. If the reading in the software says "ACTIVE", the device is activated. It can now be put in the measurement casing using the screwdriver.
   5. Repeat steps 3 & 4 with the respective other Actigraph
   6. Put the Actigraphs in their measurement-casings in the shell-backpack

#### Set-up preparation
   1. Put the laptop and tablet in the shell-backpack
   2. Close the upper lid of the black box
   3. Wind up the cable bundle of the black box and put them on the upper lid of the black box
   
#### Set-up transportation to location of measurement
   1. Timelapse (location in close proximity): You can carry the black box and the tripod (optionally chairs and the battery-backpack, depending on seating possibilities and power source) to the location by hand on multiple walks.
   2. Timelapse (location in greater distance): Attach the black box and the tripod to the silver transportation trolly. Pull out its handle at the bottom by pressing the button on the top of handle. Be careful when pulling the trolley to not lose balance! You need two operators to carry the battery-backpack and the shell-backpack.
   3. Trajectory: Carry the black box, tripod, chair(s) and battery backpack to the car used for transportation and load them carfully in safe and stable positions. 
   
#### Setting up the equipment
   1. Position the tripod securely at the desired position so that the wide opening of the mounting faces the direction that you want to measure. Use the large handle underneath the mounting to elevate the mounting in the desired position. Fix all screws on the legs of the tripod.
   2. Open the steel handle at the bottom of the tripod-mounting and carfully insert the black box in the mounting. Afterwards, close the steel handle again to secure the black-box in the mounting
   3. Hold your your smartphone horizontally against the black box and read out the direction the box is facing (in degrees), the elevation (in m) and the position in coordinates (iPhone smartphones allow this with the integrated app "Compass")
   3. Attach the GoPro and the Depth camera in their mountings. Also attach the two Actigraphs in their measurement-casings on the steel-plate at the front of the black bpx using the magnets.
   3. Start the laptop, attach the USB-hub
   4. Open the upper lid of the black box and insert the micro-USB cable in its socket in the Jeti. Also attach the magnet on the cable to the steel plate behind the Jeti.
   5. Detach the white lid on the front of the black box and pull the rail for the devices in the forward position
   6. Unroll the cable bundle and attach the USB-cables (WP690 directly to the laptop and the others to the USB-hub (also attach the hard-drive to the USB-hub)
   7. If power is available, use the WP690-power-cable. If not, attach the WP690-cable from the cable-bundle to the   battery-backpack. Insert the other end of the cable you are using into the WP690 (if you use the power-cable, tighten the thread for one rotation)

### Measurement procedures
   1. Follow the device-specific-SOPs to perform the measurements  (LabHandbook/documentation/src/sops/light-measurement-devices/)
   2. After every measurement, create a new record in the REDCap mobile APP (Username: Chrono_redcap; PW: _do you want to include this, Niloufar?_) to properly maintain the metadata
   
### Post-measurement procedures
   1. After finishing the last measurement, shut down all softwares/instruments and make sure the data is saved. Do all this according to the device-specific-SOPs!
   2. Attach the lense protection to WP690 and Jeti (after taking the lense off of Jeti)
   3. Remove the GoPro, Depth camera and Actigraphs from the black box and put them in the shell-backpack
   4. Wind up the cables (about a forearm-length in diameter) and put them on the closed lid of the black box
   5. Transport the set-up back to the office. Orientate yourself on the subpoint "Set-up transportation to location of measurement"
   6. Data saving from the devices Testo, GoPro and Actigraphs are done according to the device-specific-SOPs
