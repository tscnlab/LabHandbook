# Standard Operating Procedure for _Example Device_

_This template provides the structure for any SOP. Please add all the necessary sections. Note that, the section [General Procedure](#general-procedure) is for an overview. An experiment must be described exhaustively in [Experiment Procedures](#experiment-procedure), thus redundancy may be necessary. Moreover, for any experiment, there needs to be a project-independent description. in [Experiment Procedures](#experiment-procedure) and project-specific variations are linked in the beginning of the respective section._

_Before publishing the SOP for a device, delete any examples and italic descriptions._

_For creating neat tables, you can use a [Online Table Generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)._
