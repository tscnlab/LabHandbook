# SOP Metropsis CiViBe

All Metropsis measurements for the CiViBe project have to be done with the lens.

### Enter participant ID in system

- When opening Metropsis, click on the metropsis logo on the top left

> Make sure this step is done correctly, no name of the participant allowed, only the ID

### Experimental procedure

1. Seat the participant

   > _Please take a seat without moving the table.
   > Keep in mind that you will be here for about 15 to 20 minutes, so make sure to have a comfortable position._

2. Adapt the chin-rest first
3. Then the forehead rest
4. Finally pass the lens on by adapting its height and orientation if needed

   <aside>
   💡 *The lens support has to be in the black straps on the metal plate on the table 
   The lens has to be adapted to the person’s dominant eye, the other eye HAS to be covered with an eye patch*

   </aside>

5. Describe procedure to participant

   > _We will do X experiment that each take about 4 minutes, and will take XXX minutes in total.
   > Your task is to press buttons on the response box in front of you according to the instructions._

6. Hand participant the response box.
   1. Response box must be in the **correct direction** !!! (can just add this at the end of metropsis description for the first task - less info for participant and clearer for them)

      > _This is the response box that will record your answers.
      > For a response, please press the respective button only briefly (and lightly) so that you hear **one** beep. If you hear two beeps, you are pressing to hard or too long. If you don’t hear a beep, then press again._
7. Start the testing.

   > _We will go through one whole block without breaks, a block repeats three times three separate tests and will take about 35 to 40 minutes_

   <aside>
   💡  *One block is defined as repeating three times a combination of 3 tests without any breaks*:
   e.g. by-SCS, rg-SCS, ac-SCS > by-SCS, rg-SCS, ac-SCS > by-SCS, rg-SCS, ac-SCS

   </aside>

   > _Are you ready?
   > Then I will provide the instructions for the specific tests._

8. “START” ater instructions.
9. “STOP” (saves Experiment)
