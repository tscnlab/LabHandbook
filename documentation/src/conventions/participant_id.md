# Project ID

## Scope

The following presents a standardised way for assigning Participant IDs.

## Definition

### Core

#### Central Participant ID

Every participant that participates in our group is assigned a Central Participant ID (`CentralParticipantID`). This Central Participant ID is assigned centrally by the data base operator, which is Manuel Spitschan.

The Central Participant ID is formed as follows:

```
YY####
```

Here, `YY` corresponds to the year in double digits (i.e. `22` for the year 2022), and `####` corresponds to the running participant number from the date of entry. `####` is leading with zeros, i.e. `0001` for the first participant.

For the first participant recruited in 2022, the central participant ID would be `220001`, for the second `220002` and so forth.

#### Project Participant ID

Every participant participating in a specific project is also assigned a specific participant ID relevant for this project. This is called `ProjectParticipantID`. The number is assigned at consent and added to the central data base. The Project Participant ID is formed as runing number starting with `101`, where this is the first participant in the project.
