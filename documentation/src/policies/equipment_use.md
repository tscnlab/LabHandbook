## Background

In the unit, research data is collected using various types of physical equipment. This equipment is either used in the laboratory or given to participants for field/ambulatory measurements.

Equipment is generally shared between projects and researchers. Given finite resources, equipment is part of our assets and, therefore, should be protected and handled with care.

## General equipment use

Please follow these guidelines when using equipment:

- Read the instruction manual or handbook for any equipment carefully that you will use for your research
- Use the equipment carefully, ensuring that it remains functional and also clean
- Pay particular attention to using USB connectors and connect and disconnect cables carefully, with no use of mechanical force
- Individuals in the Unit likely have ample experience with the equipment you will be using. If you are unsure who this might be, get in touch with Manuel to ask
- Equipment should be returned in a functional and clean state such that the next person using it will have no problems using it

## Inventory

To keep track of equipment and its use, when equipment is used in a specific project or study, it needs to be officially loaned out to an individual. This helps track where equipment is and whether it is currently in use.

Upon checking out equipment for a project, please perform a first check to ensure that indeed the equipment is functional.

**NOTE: More information on inventory coming in 2025**.

## Cleaning

Equipment should be kept clean. After every participant, components that directly touch the participants' skin, such as chin rests should be disinfected. In particular wrist straps require also in-depth cleaningcleaning.

## Logging errors and faults

To be able to track errors or faults that occur with equipment, these instances of errors should be logged in the [Device malfunction reporting log](https://tuspl22-redcap.srv.mwn.de/redcap/surveys/?s=3XCYHLKJMPCNAYAP). Completing the survey triggers an email to Manuel, who will likely get in touch with further questions.
